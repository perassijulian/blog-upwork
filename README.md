# Blog

Project done as a sample to apply for a freelance job in upwork. It is a blog that allows you to classify your articles in different topics. They are automatically rendered in the navbar where hovering with the mouse displays a menu that groups them.

### Showcase

## Focus

I am focusing mostly on the logic part of it than on the design. I reaffirmed that facing personal projects and not doing courses or following tutorials is where you learn the most to solve real problems.

## Concepts

The main concepts that I reaffirmed doing this project were the concept of composable component, the use of mapping for rendering, the determination of requirements, conditional rendering, the use of SASS variables and mixin, etc.

## Status

I am currently working on this project as a test of the concepts learned related to the back end. Applying the MERN stack in conjunction with Redux.


### Stack

The stack CURRENTLY used is React.js and SASS as CSS processor.
